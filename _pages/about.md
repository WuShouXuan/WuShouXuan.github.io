# About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) and a visiting scholar in the [SIRIUS research center](https://sirius-labs.no/) at the University of Oslo (2024-2025).

[//]: # (- I have published over 10 papers on journals and conferences, and hold over 15 granted/accepted patents.)
I sever as the:
- INCOSE ASEP
- Reviewer of _Journal of Industrial Information Integration_




My research focuses on Cognitive Digital Thread (CDT) in Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), in particular with:
- Concept & Framework of CDT 
- Ontology Design / Formalization of CDT 
- Service-oriented tool-chain design for CDT
- Scenarios of CDT in MBSE development process
